# Variable_Neural_Net Without MNIST

This code takes the no of layers as variable. It also takes the no of input layer nodes and output layer nodes as input. they must match properly with the given data set. here is a sample data set given

Change the learning rate at the 3rd line of code as per requirement

# For using with MNIST

### Requirements - glob , numpy and open-cv

Download the data set from https://pjreddie.com/media/files/mnist_test.tar.gz
Extract the file and keep it in the same folder as that of the code . The filenames here actually tell their label.
Here you can use as many data-points as you want as this does not load the entire dataset during backpropagation
Change the no of test and train images at the 6th and 7th line of codeand the learning rate at the 5th line
